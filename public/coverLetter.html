      Dear Hiring Manager, <br /><br />
      I am excited to apply for the Junior Software Developer position at your

      During my academic journey, I have worked on various projects, including a
      music player, a website for a restaurant, and a simple platformer game,
      all of which can be found on my GitHub account. These projects have honed
      my skills in programming languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript. I
      am also proficient in database technologies such as MySQL and MongoDB and
      have experience with frontend development using HTML, CSS, and React.

    <p>
      As a student assistant at Hämeenlinna University of Applied Sciences, I
      have experience in assisting first-year students with a basic
      understanding of computer science, installing software on different
      machines, troubleshooting, and helping students understand the basics of
      programming. I have also assisted with building HTML websites with CSS and
      using WordPress to develop websites with child themes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I possess excellent communication and teamwork skills, and I am
      dependable, adaptable, and have a strong sense of ethics. My experience in
      leading a group project during my university years has taught me how to
      manage projects effectively while meeting deadlines and ensuring
      high-quality output. With my diverse skill set, positive attitude, and
      willingness to learn, I am confident that I would make an excellent junior
      software developer.
    </p>

    <p>
      My ultimate aim is to become a highly proficient software developer who
      can devise innovative solutions to address real-world issues. In the short
      term, I intend to acquire valuable work experience in software
      development, with a focus on improving my technical expertise and
      expanding my familiarity with various programming languages, frameworks,
      and tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      Upon graduation, my objective is to secure a position as a software
      developer at a reputable company, where I can undertake challenging
      projects, learn from seasoned professionals, and contribute to the
      creation of top-notch software applications. I believe that a
      collaborative setting that encourages creativity, experimentation, and
      continual learning is vital for my professional advancement as a
      developer.
